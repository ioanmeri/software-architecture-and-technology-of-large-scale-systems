Layers of the system
- Web
- Services
- Database
- Analytics

represents a complete system

We are interested in the **functionality** of the platform that will be used

Also, we are interested in the **non-functional** aspects of the product
- Scale

## Web applications

The frontend part of the application, we are concert how to
