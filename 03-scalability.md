## Performance vs Scalability

**Fixed Load**

- Performance
  - Low Latency
  - High Throughput
    - Concurrency
      - Single Machine - Multi-Threading
      - Multi Machine - Multi Threading + Multi Processing = Distributed Processing
    - Capacity

**Variable Load**

- Scalability
  - High Throughput
    - Ability of a system to increase its throughput by adding more hardware capacity
  - Both ways - UP and DOWN
